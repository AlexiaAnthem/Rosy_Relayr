# Relayr Task 2 - UI Test Cont.

## Performing a search using google.de

Here, I am using the Robot Framework to look up Relayr and narrow down the results by specifically selecting 'Relayr Berlin'.
This test is mostly to test functionality and a correct set up. I am using Firefox, as the geckdriver requires less set up than the Chromedriver (my personal laptop not being a DEv Env and having to match versions between Selenium + ChromeDriver).


## Additional Tests Cases would include:

- Validation via: 
keywords, 
images,
dropdown menus to select submenus
subtabs to ensure page orchestration


For a real UI test, given a page with more interaction Id forcus primarily on testing the happy path user workflow. 
Happy Path is that interaction with our webpage where the user is able to create what they want in a smooth way without bumping into any issues at all. 

Secondly, I would focus on testing all intended critical errors.
This is defined where we guide our user, via critical warnings on how to interact with our website. Examples of this could be letting them know they have reached a certain limit, letting them know they missed a step, warning them of an action that cannot be reversed, etc.
